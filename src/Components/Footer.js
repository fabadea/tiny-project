      <p>Hello, brave soldier! Here's my report about the enemy:</p>
      <p>
        Loki is tough and sneaky, your chances to defeat him are less than 10%,
        considering 14,000,605 scenarios. You need a team!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm suggesting to engage Hulk in this war. You're brave but not powerful
        enough to make Loki look like a puny God.Hulk can!
